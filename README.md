### Hello!

#### Work

I'm a scientist working for the French National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRAE). I use computational and modelling approaches to understand how crops interact with their environments. I develop tools concerning the agricultural extension sector, to improve the management of the cultivated genetic material. You can find additional information on my work and publications on my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7225-936X) and [scholar](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=pUJ5yisAAAAJ&hl=fr) pages.

I try to use my data science skills to create algorithmic art. I published these works on my [art](https://art.casadebaig.net) website, with some posts in <a rel="me" href="https://ecoevo.social/@casadebaig">mastodon</a>. You can also find some [examples](https://github.com/picasa/generative_examples) along with the [tools](https://github.com/picasa/generate) i used for creative coding here.
