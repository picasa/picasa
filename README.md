### Hello!

#### Work

I'm a scientist working for the French National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRAE). I use computational and modelling approaches to understand how crops interact with their environments. I am exploring how community ecology principles and crop modeling can help to understand less controlled and more species-varied cropping systems. You can find additional information on my work and publications on my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7225-936X) and [scholar](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=pUJ5yisAAAAJ&hl=fr) pages.

#### Play

I try to use my data science skills to create algorithmic art. I published selected works on my [art](https://art.casadebaig.net) website, along with considerations on the creation processes. You can also find some [examples](https://github.com/picasa/generative_examples) along with the [tools](https://github.com/picasa/generate) i used for creative coding here.
